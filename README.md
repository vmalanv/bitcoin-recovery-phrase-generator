‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen generates wallets using [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin, and [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing for EVM-based chains like Ethereum.

The software compares generated addresses against known address databases or checks balances in real-time via public blockchain explorers. 

Wallet Gen is built in C++ and is open-source, allowing anyone to access and modify the code. Compared to Python-based wallet generators, Wallet Gen boasts significantly higher wallet generation speeds, with performance primarily relying on your CPU & GPU.

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** employs brute-force methods to search for crypto wallets with balances.

### For Bitcoin (BTC) wallets:

*   Select option 3 in the menu or run start_search_btc.bat to search Bitcoin wallets via the internet. Be aware this method uses real-time balance checks, which may take longer.
*   Select option 6 to search Bitcoin wallets using the database. This is faster because it uses a pre-built database of known addresses with balances.

### For EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Choose option 5 or run start_search_evm.bat to search EVM wallets over the internet. This checks for wallets with balances in real-time.
*   Choose option 6 to search EVM wallets using the database. This is a more efficient approach, comparing generated wallets against a database of known balances.

### Speed Considerations:

*   Search speed depends heavily on your hardware, especially your GPU. To improve your chances, run multiple program instances (1 to 4).

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

When the program finds a wallet with a balance:
*   The search stops immediately.
*   The wallet details are shown in the console.
*   This data is saved in the ``found_wallets.txt`` file.

### How to Access the Funds?
1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the found wallet into any compatible crypto wallet.
2.  You can then transfer the funds to your wallet.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen is a Bitcoin recovery phrase generator that allows you to recover your Bitcoin wallet using the seed phrase (mnemonic phrase).

### Process Description

#### Search for missing words:

Replace the missing words with an *.

#### Entering a complete seed-phrase:

Enter the full 12-word seed.

![recovery](/asset/log.webp)

### Important recommendations

*   Seed-phrase must contain exactly 12 words.
*   Use only the * symbol to search for missing words.
*   Searching for missing words may take considerable time.
*   Successful recovery stops the program and saves data.

## My Finds

![mywallet](/asset/look.webp)

I‚Äôve recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, the second contained 0.0528 BTC (roughly $4800 at the time of discovery).
Here‚Äôs the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay).
